- [What you don't know about who you will become](http://ed.ted.com/featured/cVhQJDNq) - "Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished." Dan Gilbert shares recent research on a phenomenon he calls the "end of history illusion," where we somehow imagine that the person we are right now is the person we'll be for the rest of time. Hint: that's not the case.

- [The benefits of good posture](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-benefits-of-good-posture-murat-dalkinic) - Has anyone ever told you, “Stand up straight!” or scolded you for slouching at a family dinner?
